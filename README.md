# scalp
a simpler way to scaffold 

***Installation***

```
 npm install -g scalp
```

***Usage***

```
 scalp new <path> [-s url] 
```
creates a new skeleton with prompts for variables in `<path>` (defaults to current directory) will optionally accept a github url to use as a skeleton

If this looks very similar to Brunch to you, that's because it is.  Scalp takes just the 1st part of Brunch (the skeletons) and adds the ability easily add variables to your skeletons.
